# Assignment: Build a Linear Regression Model to Predict Stock 'Open' Prices

In this task, you are required to create a linear regression model that takes specific stock market features and predicts the 'open' price. The data provided to you contains the following columns: 'high', 'low', 'close', 'adj close', and 'volume'. Your responsibility is to use these columns as input features (independent variables) to train a linear regression model that outputs the 'open' price (dependent variable).

Your code will need to:

    Read in the dataset and extract the columns 'high', 'low', 'close', 'adj close', and 'volume' as the input (X).
    Set the 'open' price as the target variable (y) that we aim to predict.
    Split the dataset into appropriate training and testing sets (ensuring that our model can be validated properly).
    Create and fit a linear regression model to the training data.
    Use the trained model to predict 'open' prices on the test set (or any new data provided in the correct format).

The end goal is to produce predictions in the shape of an n√ó1 dimensional vector (or tensor) where each element corresponds to a forecasted 'open' price for a single data point. Ensure that your code is well-documented and modular, so others can easily read, maintain, and build upon your work.

Best Practices and Expectations:

    Check the dataset for missing or anomalous values, and handle these issues appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal, or other data-cleaning steps).
    Clearly separate data-preprocessing steps from model training and prediction steps.
    Provide clear function definitions and docstrings. This will help your colleagues understand the logic and flow of data through the code.
    Include basic performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate how well your model performs.

By following these guidelines, you will create a reproducible and efficient workflow that highlights your ability to transform stock market data into actionable predictive insights. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please reach out for clarification or assistance. """
